The file template.htm is linked to main.css. 
However, above that, it is linked to my2.css (blank).

Again, write rules in my2.css to style the document, without altering the html, main.css or the order of linking of the stylesheets:

- Make the main header background blue
- Make the <article> h1s green and as big as the main heading
- Give all  <article>s a red background
- Make all the headers use a sans-serif font
- Make the News paragraphs text green
- Make the footer paragraph text blue
- Make the footer background black, and the text white
- Make the hover state on the footer links have black text on a white background
- Make the default colour of text links grey
